# Single-cell deconvolution of human neocortex development and its molecular determinants
During development, the prefrontal cortex is generated through waves of neuronal differentiation, where precursor cells mature into various neuron types. To better understand this complex process, we analyzed scRNA-seq datasets from multiple stages of fetal development to create a comprehensive single-cell atlas detailing the diversity of cell types present throughout neurogenesis. Additionally, by using advanced bioinformatics techniques such as differentiation trajectory exploration and gene regulatory network analysis, we have been able to characterize and gain deeper insights into the pathways of direct and indirect neurogenesis, as well as reconstruct gene regulatory networks to identify novel markers of transcriptional regulation.
